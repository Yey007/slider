# Slider Device

The Arduino device code for moving the slider.

## Building and Running

You need a working Arduino install, either in the form of the official Arduino IDE, the official Arduino CLI, or the VSCode Arduino extension (or other IDE extensions). I've personally only tested the build using the VSCode extension, but it should hypothetically work anywhere.

You also need to have the [TMCStepper](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/tmcstepper/) library installed.

Then, just build/run the project however you usually would with whatever you're using.
