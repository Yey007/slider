# slider

Motorizing/automating my camera slider!

## Objective

My camera slider works fine, but I have to push it around manually if I want to actually use it. That's way too much work. Plus, manual operation can lead to inconsistent takes, which sucks if the timing of the shot is critical. My goal is to use 3D printed parts, an Arduino, and a Flutter app to motorize my slider.

## Project Structure

There are two directories: `app` and `device`. `app` contains all the code for the Flutter app, and `device` contains all the code for the Arduino.

> [!NOTE]
> CAD files and circuit diagrams are currently not available on GitHub, but will probably be added soon.

## Building and Running

You can view build and run instructions for the Flutter app [here](app/README.md).

You can view build and run instructions for the Arduino code [here](device/README.md).
